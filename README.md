# The Shoppies: Movie awards for Entrepreneurs (My Take)

Task
-
A web app that a user can search up movies to nominate for an award, view their nominated list and remove nominations if necessary. Users can onlu have up to 5 nominations.

Full Challenge can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZO0BZwn1Aogj4f3PDNe1mhq8pKsXZxtrG--EIbP_-w/preview?pru=AAABdHlQRnE*WQl0v68vsF_nPbygOim7ww#heading=h.31w9woubunro)

Below I am going to go through my thought process on how I chose to break down and approach this task. üôÇ


Identified Basic Workflow
-

| Key        | Entity        |
| ---------- |:-------------:|
| m   | movie |
| n   | nomination |
| r   | result (from search)|
| u   | user |

- u opens website
- searches for m
- r generated
  - if exists, display r to u
  - if not, display 'no matching results'
- u nominates r
  - if n == yes, action not available

Identified Actions
-
The order mentioned is also the order of functionality I chose, to know what to implement next. (I hope this sentence makes sense üòÇ)
- search from m -> search
- view all n -> print
- add to n -> insert
- remove from n -> delete

Technical Requirements (From Challenge)
- 
- display banner when n == 5
- only movies should be displayed
- search results must contain at least
  - title
  - year of release
- API key -> [OMDB's API (free)](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

Tech Stack Consideration
-
| Technology       | Used?        |
| ---------- |:-------------:|
| JSON | ‚ùå |
| node.js | ‚ùå |
| express.js | ‚ùå |
| HTML | ‚ùå |
| CSS | ‚úÖ |
| Bootstrap | ‚úÖ |
| React.js | ‚úÖ |
| graphQL | ‚ùå |
